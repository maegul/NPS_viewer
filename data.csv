Other sections regarding pipes, filters, loops, and figures need a bit more time I feel. It takes quite a bit of thinking and needs to be repeated a few times in order to understand it. 

Overall a good workshop though. I feel i understood most of it, or will at least be able to come back to something I was unsure of and learn it properly. 

The GitHub part at the very end went right over my head. Usually things towards the end of the day went un-learned heh.

Needed to see more real world applications of data. Example problems more maths based than data-manipulation based. For somebody out of practice with maths it was hard to follow, as you got lost in the maths and then couldn't make sense of the programming logic. 

In general more help needs to be provided during the lecture portion. Once you fall behind or don't understand something, you can not catch up at all.

When we created the graphs it was a bit clearer, but the other questions seemed a bit abstract without the context of how it could be used in the real world.

An explanation of the process and provision of definitions before any hands on begins for students. e.g. what is a variable, string, tokenising.

Instruction moved Very quickly. Thats ok, as long as there are regular pauses that will allow people to 'catch up'/ assess the steps.

When entering data wait until students have also entered data before proceeding with explanations.

I can understand wanting to group classes compactly, but perhaps have a longer break between classes - 1 day or more -so as to give students enough opportunity to review work covered in class.  

Very interested in the new tools and would like to develop some proficiencies, but NLTK will not be of real benefit for me until OCR is available.

135,5/2/2016 19:41:04,Introduction to UniMelb HPC and Introduction to the NeCTAR Cloud,3.0,"As an introduction course I felt it somewhat missed the mark. It was both too techncal for the beginner and not enough information for the more intermediate user. It was a nice intro to some basics of NeCTAR as well as gave some key insights into Spartan. I would have liked to hear more about migrating our existing Edward workflows to Spartan and gaining some insights into best practices on this new chimera platform.  I also would have preferred to hear more insights on why I would want to use NeCTAR (what computational problems would it help me solve), what resources are available for how long (and how much) beyond the training profile, and what 'typical' users are using it for.

Across the board, the how-to guides and on-line resources were great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,5/3/2016 21:49:41,Introduction to UniMelb HPC and Introduction to the NeCTAR Cloud,9.0,"I'm sure this sort of class is very tricky because the participants will have such widely varying experience and computing requirements. What would have helped me personally (rusty but comfortable with the idea of command line interface, newcomer to both Melbourne Uni and HPC and cloud computing) was a short orientation, with brief examples, of what situations would suit Spartan vs a Nectar cloud instance, what the differences/similarities are, etc. I have specific interests in the facilities for Monte Carlo simulations in statistics (HPC I assume) but also always interested in knowing what else is available that can be put to unanticipated good use.
I acknowledge this might have been boring for those well used to the unimelb system though. 

I may have missed the interconnections between the alternating Nectar and HPC sessions. Setting up the demo Nectar instance was good practical stuff. I wasn't sure why that was separated by the HPC segments. 
I don't know exactly what, but something similarly hands-on for setting up a simple HPC job might have been good? In two separate halves?
(Again acknowledging the Edward veterans might have been bored...)

Overall a beneficial course though, nicely taught. It's great to know you guys are there for this.

149,5/9/2016 14:04:46,NLTK (Natural language processing),10.0,"It's probably really hard for you guys to know exactly where to pitch at, with the various levels of technical expertise in your audience. And I think it was good you guys adapted to the skills of your audience as the lesson went on. I totally got this and I think you guys handled a difficult problem well, but I was still left wishing we could have gone a little deeper.

So here are a couple things I think would have been or could be cool:

- Direction to some ""further reading,"" or something: We covered some of the basic data analysis and wrangling techniques, which is obviously where to start and there's only so much time, and so on. Still, it kind of left me with the question, ""What next?"" What are some cool ways of analysing text data? I know PDFs are a pain - how should I deal with them? This kind of stuff is beyond the scope of a one-day course and, well, there's the internet, but God, there's so much of the internet - it can really help having someone direct you to three or four links that can help you take the next step.

- ""Advanced NLTK"" or ""NLTK for programmers"": I know demand would be limited, but as more people take to NLTK? I don't know. A more advanced session would be neat, if you guys can muster the people together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After we successfully navigate one project together, we close it and set one up by ourselves with the trainer coming around as required.

However, I felt it went a bit too fast for me to keep up.  I struggled with most of the challenges as they were a ad too difficult.  I think to make this better I'd recommend a slower pacing of the course.  In terms of the learning, I'd recommend mixing it up so it is a bit mroe different than showing how to do something, then giving a challenge.  For example, with teh plotting part of the course at the end of day one - we were given code and then asked to work backwards trying to explain what it was doing.  I found this was very helpful and helped me to see what was actually going on.

Overall, was a good course and I am looking forward to day 3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got left far behind, which meant I didn't get much out of the second day as I mentally ""gave up"". It was hard to listen and at the same time copy out the examples so that I could examine and test them. Probably not much could be done about this as probably most others were coping OK.

If the codes in the completed curriculum can be all clearly annotated, it would help me to understand the structure of the syntax and the vocabulary better.

If this was done, for example, if we had already downloaded all the programs on our laptops before attending, we would have saved some time and then have had more time for the participants to dabble in the new tools with the awesome experts in the room! :)

Overall, I learnt so much from the event, and I've already started using some tools for my research! The best part is, I never expected to use these tools (didn't know most of them existed!!), but now that I do, I can't seem to get enough of them! Also, my supervisor is super impressed by the quality of some plots and maps I've been showing! :) Thank you!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of us in this class were beginners in using HPC but I think this session assumed that we already knew something in that area, so it was too quick for me at least... Also we didn't actually try to do something ourselves... so it was all watching the script! I was hoping to submit some jobs myself and solve some practice questions...
Thanks again.

442,8/4/2016 23:02:20,R (Programming and data analysis),8.0,"I would change the whole set up to presenting a research question and how to use R to answer the research question just like in the real world. 

Research Question: What were the characteristics of the people who were more likely to die on the titanic? (or something similar)

Using R to answer the above question
- tour of the R page
- flow of cohersion
- importing data - the titanic file
- saving files
- cleaning data- how to look at the outliers in the dataset
- looking at central tendency - of the variables to answer the question
- creating graphs - to help answer the quesiton
- creating tables to answer the question
- how to create variables to answer the question
- and then the more interesting aspects of R - eg. piping to answer the above question

 I feel as R was so foreign to what I have done before, I feel that I could understand it better if I could attach what you were doing to something that I was familiar with. At the moment, I felt that R was taught in pieces and a bit abstract.  There were some examples with the titanic but no real overarching research question, some examples with cats, some examples with lucky numbers, some examples with temperature - it jumped all over the place and made it harder to follow for a beginner - cognitive overload :)

However, I think the whole concept of ResBaz is fantastic and that it's great that you are asking for feedback.

However, I obviously missed lots because back on my own, I am not having much success with the templates downloaded from ""...cryptarch"" .... It would be great to have a follow-up session to work on getting some of my work into Latek templates to get off and running.

One requirement I have for my thesis is putting landscaped tables over several pages into a portrait document. I have found some suggestions online but don't really know how to put them in to effect.

half an hour was spent trying to get the training environment set up, everyone could have simply been instructed to install a Latex program specified and the online version was glitchy.
half an hour was also used as lunch break which had not been noted.
More time needed to be spent on bibliographies as this is a major point for thesis writing. Information like getting bibtek format from various reference software would of been useful instead of being told to type it manually, that is prone to error.

567,9/7/2016 17:07:49,Intro to Programming Concepts,6.0,"It is not very much tailored to researchers or students/graduates that want to learn programming but more to older people that wants to learn what their kids are doing (would be awesome for my mom btw). All the ""interactive activities"" that we did at the beginning are good for people lacking abstraction rather than graduates (who are supposed to have at least that basic skills). From a graduate/researcher perspective, those exercises were a but of a waste of time when we could have gone straighter to the juice. Probably more advanced and specific courses will be much denser and content packed. Overall, great effort and please keep up with all these good activities. Maybe some should only be advertised to a more specific target.

Also, I've checked the photos on 'storify' and I'm not featured in any consequential way, but I have a family violence issue that otherwise precludes my image from inclusion online (thanks to the ever-improving facial recognition and linking technologies). It would be good to check at the beginning (or before) and throughout in some way before taking photos and publishing online.

They are very passionate and knowledgeable, but they clearly don't know how to teach beginners. Many of the students were totally left behind. Simple educational techniques would have helped here, e.g. use the whiteboard to list each LINUX command as it's introduced. Many times the presenters slipped into jargon, which wasn't  explained properly. A lot of the extraneous history could have been left out. The handout was very useful.. perhaps considering building on this. For example, you could set up some basic exercises that a beginner could follow which would explore the fundamental concepts behind LINUX and HPC systems - navigating directory trees, looking at text files, shell scripts, batch submission, etc. Explanations of the HPC concept were generally very good - the analogy of ""one powerful horse"" vs ""many horses"" was well presented.

-printed handouts with the challenges so its easier to refer back to where we are up to. Once you get a bit lost, its hard to work out what we're up to doing if it was just mentioned in passing 
-setting up two projectors with split screens to see code and output side by side
-splitting workshops into two workshops one in basic programming and a longer on just on visualisations so people can come in a bit more on their level
-maybe putting participants in buddy groups so one more experienced programmer is with one less experienced programmer for more peer-to-peer learning

This helps us internalize what's happening and be more comfortable in the future. This would obviously affect the length of the class which could be problematic.

Their presentations were very poor to say the least and the majority of them did not appropriately introduce the software that they were presenting.
In addition, one of the speakers made comments/assumptions about the age of the audience, which is very, very unprofessional.
I strongly believe that if this seminar was designed with a male audience as the focus, the standard of the speakers and presentations would have been much, much better.

It is a little intense for a whole day, especially for someone new to programming. I think it would be helpful to have the helpers and instructors assigned to help out specific tables with each of the challenges as opposed to roaming around. It can be a little intimidating to ask for help if you're completely lost, so being able to help students as a group in an intentional way as opposed to the onus on a student ask for help might help with the learning process. It would also be helpful if the instructors could offer some additional resources for continued learning (e.g. books or websites) Overall, I enjoyed the course and appreciate increasing my skills in digital literacy!

I've have personally had negative experiences with this group and don't believe that such a divisive and questionable organisation should be referenced in such a lax way within the context of University business. We are an internationally regarded institution and we should be showing more discretion in such matters and not blithely making such references.

I could suggest 2 things:

1. Maybe email all the attendees beforehand with instructions on how to set up everything you need before the class...software, GitHub account, etc. Of course not all students will do that but it might help some...

2. I think the class was well paced and set the background that was necessary to do. But it would be good to go into use of the Command Line functionality of Github, but I understand this might require a 2nd workshop....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Intro to Python course was great and well paced, in particular the introduction to conditionals and loops.
But unfortunately 'functions' were at the end and a bit rushed...it would be great if the Intro course could maybe be split into 3 instead of 2 so that there could be one workshop devoted to writing functions (including lambdas) with more detail and more opportunity for practice/examples, because this is often the part that becomes most challenging.

So, that part was really tough.  Also, there were times when you could do the same thing in multiple ways, and it wasn't clear why you would want to use one approach over another one.  Some of that clarification would have been helpful.  I REALLY liked having the challenges along the way.  I thought that was an extremely beneficial part of the workshop.

1574,9/19/2018 14:01:19,R (Programming and data analysis),6.0,"On the whole a good workshop, but could do with a bit more thought as to the delivery of the workshop.

Access to the google docs etc was good.

It would be also good to a copy of the coding file up on the web somewhere. 

To start on time would be good and then wouldn't have to race through the presentation. Then only the people who were late would need to catch up and not the whole group be put behind and under time pressure
- the material was presented as fast as the presenter could type
- if the material is delivered too fast, it doesn't allow for time for the information    to sink in and then you are unable to ask important questions in places where you don't understand. The information gets washed over your head.
- it would be great if one data set could be used and everything that is being presented to be put in context. 
At the moment, some of the information is being presented out of context. Memory works better if you can attach new information to already existing information. 
- for eg. This is the Titanic data set. It has these variables - set the scene
- What we want to look at is blah blah.
- We do this by blah blah
- 
In today's workshop, while loops were presented - but no explanation as to when we would need to use a while loop - no context to attach this new information to.

Resbaz is a great service - keep on improving and it will be a really good workshop

The room and table setup were pretty bad. Seriously, whats wrong with a square desk at this uni, my neck is getting sore from always having to sit at an angle to the person doing the talking? TV's were pointed inwards to the middle of the room so that people on the sides couldn't see. The loud music(?) during the first working session was annoying. 

Change: rows of desks and think about where people are going to be sitting when positioning screens. Your choice of ""thinking"" music might not be everyone elses.

I was a little concerned about the email that went out 1 DAY BEFORE the talk with a link to an intro to python review that I didn't have time to look at and that also went on about it being an advanced python course with serious prerequisites.

Change: Dude, chill out, it's charts and stuff, not rocket science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd personally prefer jumping straight in at the 3 Pet Peeves--it's so valuable to know these.

I'm not sure we need to know how to add and subtract. We can work these out ourselves. The Pet Peeves are incredible value add. Also, showing us a simplified application to research nice and early (even if it's just a simple thing like making a graph, or sorting some data) would be on the wish list.

If I were to ask for improvements for the future, it would be more challenges, and also perhaps working on things that directly relate to our research activities, eg. opening a csv file of data, generating summary statistics, running some analyses. I know it would seem that we need lots of fundamentals before these tasks, but I am confident that we could be shown how to open a data file and run simple analysis, and then we could back-fill some of the fundamentals in our own time, given some notes of what to cover.

This was a great workshop, a very good use of time and resources, and Jonathan is a great instructor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1869,4/17/2019 13:10:11,Python (Programming and data analysis),10.0,"Fantastic course, was a great pace for me as a newcomer to programming, and the gradual progression of difficulty of the examples we worked through kept me engaged the whole time. Jon Garber presents so well and comes across as very warm and approachable. He said at one point he's 'not actually the best programmer' (which I don't believe), but even if that was true it wouldn't matter because he is an excellent teacher of programming which is more important than being the best at actually doing the programming. Also I think the live action/real world examples like the candy cabinet are great. I'm sure I'll be back for more training here.

The pace we covered content wasnt too fast, or slow,  just right. The teacher and team were also very pleasant and friendly. I will without a doubt be exploring other workshops to enhance my skill set. Thank you for your time in helping me get comfortable with the MATLAB software. it will really help my data analysis , and accelerate the research process. 

Kind regards, 

Andrew Butler","Overall I would not change much. However, an additional nice touch may be : everyone gets given data of something, maybe everyone gets emailed a small video file. Then they have to download a premade analysis script. The teacher could then run through how to use premade scripts to go through more complex data types. Maybe break down the script and teach how to analyse the codes sections and to learn what each part does. so you can modify it to fit the demands of your research analysis. 

I just think it would be a nice touch because a lot of beginners won't actually have to write much scripts, they will just be downloading premade ones for pipeline analysis of big data sets. So I think thier application and modification would be a nice additional aspect for the course. Maybe in for a part 3 workshop? 
It is just a thought though.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Great explanation of the teaching material
- Great working examples to let us struggle just a bit to learn. Not too difficult to give up, not too easy to feel not challenging at all
- Overall, I felt that the skills acquired from this session were really empowering","- cannot get out from the venue to get a quick bite (if I don't feel like snacks), need access card to go back in. This is only relevant in that location after business hour. Possibly let people know in advance that they might want to bring their own food to get through till 8pm",,,I'm working through my understanding of this research skill.,I understand and plan on using this skill for my research!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I understand and plan on using this skill for my research!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was interactive and interesting . Thank you very much,"some critical part was so fast, I was not able to catch up and later on I couldn't do the challenge since i didn't understand the concept deep enough. I guess it is very important to spend bit more time in designing a way to explain the concept ,for example (""c"" concept of combine"" ) or structure of codes and functions. also at end of each session it is good to dedicate 2-4 min just for questions.

2. The trainer Pablo was very clear and engaging.
3. Course material taught in the class was at a suitable beginner level, and very relevant to my work.
4. Volunteers were amazing! Very helpful to have them in the room. Without them, I would have completely fallen behind about three times. Thanks to them, I was able to keep up with the class.
Thank you. Fantastic to have this course on offer, and amazing it is free!","1. Allow us into the room at least 20 minutes before. We only had about two minutes to set up before Pablo started talking. Luckily I had set everything up on my laptop the night before (launched R Studio, opened the recommended R cheat sheets, a file for taking notes, and ensured my computer would have internet), but if I hadn't had done this, I would have been behind from the beginning.
2. Pablo types very fast. Slow it down just a little bit, or breath :-), to allow us mere mortal typers to catch up. The three times when I fell behind, it was because of a typo in my code or a forgotten comma, due to rushing. We finished 15 minutes early for lunch and 20 minutes early at end of day, so there was time for a small reduction in speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I understand and plan on using this skill for my research!,I understand and plan on using this skill for my research!,I'm working through my understanding of this research skill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2375, ,NLTK (Natural language processing),6.0,"For my skill level it would have been helpful to have some info on how basic coding works at the start e.g. use of brackets, spaces, type of language. Also feel some things went too fast but with the notes and offer of help at later times I will be able to catch up on things I don't understand. It gave me an overivew of what Python does but not sure if I have the skills to yet to use it. Good course though and will be useful for colleagues.
